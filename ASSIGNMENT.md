# Code test - Flickr Gallery
​
The assignement is to create photo gallery that uses the public API from flickr to retrieve and display images on a web page. Choose a category of your preference, for example cats. Any other additional features is up to you, see list for some examples.
​
All _JavaScript_ should be written with [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/). __This means that no frameworks or libraries are allowed__. You are however allowed to use build steps such as webpack and babel to enable modern ES features and modular code.
​
Same goes for _HTML/CSS_. Everything should be written from scratch, that is, no frameworks are allowed. Preprocessors such as Sass is OK.
​
We will review the readability and structure of your code.
​
Please deliver the solution as a zip-file including the source code along with any instructions on how to run the application.
​
## Requirements
​
The gallery must...
​
* Be responsive from mobile and up.
* Fill 100% of it's container.
* Be independent of content outside it's container.
* Not affect other elements on the page.
* Give user feedback when loading or if the API is unresponsive.
* Work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
​
## Example features (optional)
​
* Automated tests for parts of the solution.
* Endless scroll
* Persistence/caching: save data from the API to a caching store and use this with repeated requests.
* Build step with linting, concatenation, and minifying.
